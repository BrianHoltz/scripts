- Create a concise and descriptive commit message summarizing the git diff.
- If there are no staged changes, describe the unstaged changes.
- Agents must use git commands as necessary to determine what changes are staged or unstaged.
  - For example, use git --no-pager diff --cached to inspect staged changes and git --no-pager diff for unstaged changes.
- Do not assume the conversation context is the authority for what has changed. Always verify with git commands.
- Use Conventional Commits standard.
- Don't document trivial changes that a future developers/agents would not search for.
- For guidance about how to present copyable raw ANSI text, refer to AgentRules.md.
- If git commands show no output in the terminal, refer to AgentRules.md.
