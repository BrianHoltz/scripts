- When asked for a git commit message, check the git diff from scratch, and do not assume the conversation context is the authority for what has changed.
- Use Conventional Commits standard
- The commit message should be optimized for developers who are trying to find the commit that made a particular change.
- Don't document trivial changes unless they could plausibly need to sought by future developers.
- Show draft commmit msg as INLINE PLAINTEXT, not as rich bulleted text, and not in a file.
